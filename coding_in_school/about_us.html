            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>Coding in Schools is a new nonprofit committed to helping high schools build strong, sustainable computer science programs. We provide the curriculum, resources, and teacher training schools need to offer meaningful CS learning opportunities for all students—especially in under-resourced communities.</p>
            <p>We work closely with school districts, technology partners, and educators to expand access to high-quality CS education. Our core services include offering a library of standards-aligned curricula, leading professional development workshops for teachers, and supporting schools with grant applications to secure essential technology and equipment. Together, we’re closing the CS opportunity gap and ensuring every student has the tools to succeed in a digital future.</p>
