            <h2>Why We’re Building a Stronger Digital Presence</h2>
            <p>CS Pathways is expanding rapidly, but we know our current online presence doesn’t fully reflect the depth or impact of our work. Without a centralized digital hub, it can be challenging for partner schools, educators, and donors to explore our programs, access sample curriculum materials, or learn how our initiatives are transforming student opportunities. Strengthening our online presence will make it easier for new schools to join our network, support our ability to scale, and provide donors and community partners with a clearer understanding of the difference their support makes.</p>

            <h2>Our Goal</h2>
            <p>Our goal is to become the premier resource for high schools seeking to build and expand computer science education. By strengthening our digital presence, we aim to establish greater credibility, increase visibility across the region, and make it easier for schools to explore and join our programs. This centralized platform will also support a more efficient partnership process and create a reliable pipeline for donor engagement, ensuring long-term growth and impact in computer science education.</p>
